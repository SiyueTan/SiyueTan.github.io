    <p id="p4">Who are the families in the society that have enough financial strength to pay for tuition?</p>

    <p id="Read">International students in the United States often pay more to attend school than local students, including paying <b>“out-of-state” </b>tuition at publicly-funded state schools and additional charges aimed at oversees entrants. Many students attending state universities in this state are beneficiaries of these allowances. They only need to pay half of the tuition. The visualization below shows the comparison of tuition fees between the state and the other states
        on Education.</p>

    <div id="left"></div>
    <div id="right"></div>
    <script src="./script2.js"></script>

    <p id="p4">Out-of-state students and international students pay almost twice as much tuition as in-state students <br> <br></p>

    <p id="p2">Big schools that are household names are likely to have a long waiting list of possible enrollees, available to take the place of any international student, said Terry Hartle, senior vice president of government and public affairs for the American Council on Education, which represents schools in Washington, DC. <br><br>The average student loan in 2019 is 32731$. Although the salary seems to be optimistic. In reality, it will take closer to <b>20 YEARS</b> to pay back the student loan.  International students as strong tuition contributors also need to rethink the value of the high education.</p>

    <p id="p4">
        Does high education as the same as it used to be? This is a question worth to think<br><br>

    <p id="p3">“it’s no secret that many international students pay full tuition, and that this is a source of revenue that enables schools to offer student aid and other discounts to other students.”<br></p>
